erl_img: Erlang image processing library
========================================

erl_img is a library for reading, writing, scaling, and cropping image files.
The goal is to provide the Erlang community with functionality similar to
ImageMagick. erl_img was originally excavated from the Jungerl repository, but
a number of modifications have since been made.

API
---

To use erl_img, you will need to include the erl_image.hrl header file to get
the appropriate record definitions. If you're using rebar, an include like this will work:

```
-include_lib("erl_img/include/erl_img.hrl").
```

The erl_img API is:

```
% Read
erl_img:load("/path/to/image.ext") -> {ok, IMG#erl_image}

% Get the MIME type
erl_img:mime_type(IMG) -> "image/something"

% Scale
IMG1 = erl_img:scale(IMG, 0.5) % scale factor

% Crop
IMG2 = erl_img:crop(IMG1,
        IMG1#erl_image.width / 2,  % new width
        IMG1#erl_image.height / 2, % new height
        IMG1#erl_image.width / 4,  % x offset
        IMG1#erl_image.height / 4) % y offset

% convert to PNG
IMG3 = IMG2#erl_image{ type = image_png, filename = "/path/to/image.png" }

% Write
erl_img:save(IMG3) -> ok
```

Formats
-------

As of this writing, the number of image formats is fairly limited. The following
table summarizes file format support present in erl_img:

```
Format      Read/Write/Metadata?

BMP         Read only
GIF         Read only
JPEG        Read only
PNG         Read/Write/Metadata
TGA         Read/Write
TIFF        Read/Metadata
XPM         Read only
```

Even if your desired format can be written, note that you may have to perform
addtional processing to convert one format to another. Pixel information is
stored in a number of formats internally, and some file types only support some
formats. For example, if you read a file in BGR format, but the destination
file type only supports RGB, it is your responsibility to perform the
pixel-by-pixel channel reversal.

The following table summarizes the pixel formats that can be read and written
by each file type.

```
              BMP  GIF  JPEG  PNG  TGA  TIFF XPM

```

TODO
----

* `erl_img:scale/2` is currently producing garbled images.
    - It is using bicubic interpoliation, perhaps it is not exactly right
    - Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation
* Very limited coverage in the eunit tests. Need images and a lot more tests.
